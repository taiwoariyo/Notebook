# Below are are some examples showing Arithmetic evaluation of expressions in Python

# In[1]:


#This is a simple Arithmetic expression to multiply and add integers

(3*4)+5


# In[4]:


#This expression would convert 200 minutes into hours by dividing the given nunmber of minutes by 60

Minutes=200
